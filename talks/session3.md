# The Past, Present, and Future of Rails at GitHub
## Eileen M. Uchitelle

- 2007 - github born on 2007
- 2008 - Rails moves to github
- 2009 - Github forks Rails... and Ruby
- 2014 - Finished the slow upgrade to rails 3.0
- 2018 - Finished upgrade to 4.2 and started 5.2
- 2019 - Finished upgrade to 5.2 and broke away from fork

New upgrade tools:
-  dual boot ci rails in 2 versions and focus on test failures (shopify talks)

You should...
- Build a team
- take time to make a plan
- fix deprecation warnings early
- plan for the future
